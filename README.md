# JSON-Navbar

I was looking for a way to load my navbar items without having to change them on every page manually and i decided to make this, its probably been done before and it theres probably thousands of ways to do it better or alternatives that are more simple but this is the way i decided to do mine (Suggest you only do this on smaller sites with limited traffic)
